## Project Info

Linear Regression is a tool for understanding the relationship between two types of data: the independent variable (which is used for prediction) and the dependent variable (which is to be predicted). 

The goal is to find the best straight line that describes how the data changes with each other. For example, such as predicting a person's salary (dependent variable) based on years of work experience (independent variable), it helps to find a regression line that best represents how salary changes as work experience increases. This line should be as accurate as possible to correctly predict the value. 

The above code includes three main steps: data preparation, modeling, and evaluation/visualization. 

- The data preparation stage involves importing and processing the data. 

- In the modeling stage, the Linear Regression model is selected, trained, and predicted. 

- The evaluation/visualization stage involves assessing the performance of the model and visualizing the prediction results. 

Through these steps, we successfully understood the concept of Simple Linear Regression and applied it in data processing to perform salary prediction based on work experience. This project helped improve the understanding of how this technique can be used in real-world contexts for data analysis and prediction.
